To simplify the installation process, the required FFmpeg executables (`ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`) are already included in this 7zip archive named `Extract_Here.7z`. Simply right-click on `Extract_Here.7z` and select "Extract Here." This will place the correct files in the `bin` directory.


File Structure Should Look Like This (After Extraction):

youtube-downloader/
├── bin/
│   ├── ffmpeg.exe
│   ├── ffprobe.exe
│   └── Extract_Here.7z
└── ...
